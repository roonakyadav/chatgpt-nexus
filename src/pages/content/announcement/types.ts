/**
 * Schema for the remote announcement feed (announcements.json).
 *
 * Single-current-announcement model. To re-pop the bubble for everyone,
 * bump `current.id` (the id is the only "is this new?" signal — the rest
 * of the fields are content that can change freely).
 *
 * Stored at:
 *   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/roonakyadav/chatgpt-nexus/refs/heads/main/announcements.json
 *
 * Add a `history` array later if/when we want to render a "past
 * announcements" list inside the modal. The schema bump (`v: 2`) would
 * be backwards-compatible — `current` stays at top level, parsers that
 * only know v=1 can keep working.
